# True Bypass Relay for DIY Guitar Pedals / Effects

A beginner friendly intro to programming / microcontrollers for DIY pedal enthusiasts.

This repo should give you everything you need to add digital relay controls to your projects. This is a fully DIY project. At this time I do not sell pre-programed or pre-fab boards.
This repo will give you the files needed to get your own PCBs assembled / programmed and to include the framework into your own custom PCBs.

## Features

* Quick press to toggle Effect On / Bypass.
* Hold down when off to temporarily engage effect.
* Hold down when on to temporarily bypass effect.
* Remembers settings when powered off.
* Programmable Status LED. One built in or control the LED on a parent PCB if using PedalPCB boards.
* Wiring is directly compatable with PedalPCB.com kits.
* Rated up to 6.4 million cycles. (Can be extended in program but that will be overkill)
* Fully open source. Use in your DIY pedals or adapt into your commercial projects.

## What you will need

* An Arduino or dedicated UPDI programmer. Recommended: Adafruit UPDI Friend [Adafruit UPDI Friend](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5879)
* A SPST Momentary Foot Switch / Button - Normally Open. Recommended: [Love My Switches Pro Footswitch](https://lovemyswitches.com/spst-momentary-foot-switch-normally-open-soft-touch-pre-wired-with-connector/)
* The PCB. JLCPCB Production Files and BOM are provided. Can easily be modified to your preffered PCB vendor.
* The Arduino IDE [Arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
* (Optional but recommended) JST SH Compatible 1mm Pitch 3-pin Plug-Plug Cable for programming. [JST Cable from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6404)
